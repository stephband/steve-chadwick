<!DOCTYPE html>

<!--
This is an HTML comment.

A comment is not read by the browser. Comments are only seen by you and me,
the developers reading the source code of the page. They are useful for
leaving notes about how things work, like I'm doing now. All languages have
comments. In HTML they start with <!--. You'll have to look at the end of
this comment to see how they end, I can't write it here because it would
end this comment, and I'm not finished with it yet.

That thing above, the <!DOCTYPE html>, that told the browser that this is
an HTML document. It has to be the very first thing in the code, even
before any comments. It says: 'everything that follows is HTML'. It's
important, but you can forget about it now, it's just one of those things
that has to be there.

When you become more familiar with this page, you should probably delete
all these comments. The browser has to download them all, even if it can't
read them!

Ok, I'm finished with this comment. Here's how a comment ends:
-->

<!--
This next thing, below, the <html> tag, tells the browser 'the HTML
document begins here'. If you scroll down to the very bottom of this
document you will see a similar tag </html>, and that says, 'the HTML
document ends here'. This is how HTML tags work. They come in opening
and closing pairs: <html> </html>.

Except, and there's always an except on the web, tag that close themselves.
Images, for example have the tag <img src="url" />. Notice how the slash is
placed at the end of the tag? This is called a self-closing tag.

So, two types of HTML tag â€“ tags that open and close:

<p>Paragraph text</p>

And tags that close themselves:

<img src="url" />

Easy. You'd think so, but you'll find a lot of mistakes are made, as a
beginner, by forgetting to close HTML tags.

    Next we have the document <head>. The <head> is not visible in the browser.
    Everything in the head is hidden. It's used to provide meta information
    about the document, and to load in stylesheets so the browser knows how to
    display the content of the body before the <body> arrives.

    Before the <body> arrives? I hear you say.

    Yes, before the <body> arrives. You see, an HTML document is displayed in
    parts, as it is being downloaded. You know how when you go to a URL in your
    browser you see bits of the page first, and then other bits of the page,
    and then finally the whole page? The HTML is being downlaoded and displayed
    in parts, starting at the top and going down.

    In this document, for example, the browser will have to download this
    comment before it even gets to the <head> or the <body>. It's quite a long
    comment, so you should probably delete it to speed up page load.

        These tags are what gets displayed in twitter or Facebook when someone
        shares the URL to this page. You can get rid of this if you don't want
        to be bothered with it. Or leave it here until you decide to do
        something with it. It's not really 'standard' HTML, you have to go to
        Facebook and Twitter to learn about what you can put in these meta tags

    Right, now we are coming to the meat and potatoes. The <body>. This is
    the content of your document. Most things inside the body are displayed
    by the browser.

    I have copied the body of your txti, since it seemed an easy place to
    start, and just cleaned it up a little. And added some comments.
    -->
    <body>
        <h1>Steve Chadwick - Trumpet and <em>other instruments</em></h1>
        <h2>Performer, studio musician, composer, arranger, educator.</h2>

        I have downloaded your photos and put them in the ./images folder. After
        all, why rely on imgur being available when we can serve them from the same
        place as this document and know that they will be available whenever this
        document is?Hopefully it's easy to see what I've done here, and you can
        add more as you like.

        This is a bit of an aside, but if you have loads of images, I have a
        thing that could help. It's not for right now, but in the future we could
        install this if you like:

        <p><strong>I specialise in jazz and improvised music but I am equally as
        comfortable reading in a big band, show band, orchestra or other.</strong></p>

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I grew up in the vicinity of Manchester, UK, and now live on the island
        of Gotland, Sweden arriving here via Washington DC, London and Berlin. I
        studied for a degree in music in Salford in the 90's and have worked
        professionally as a musician (and all that entails) ever since. Folk,
        jazz, big band, funk, pop, orchestral, improv etc..etc...</p>

        <p>Other instruments: alto sax, trombone, accordion, percussion, ukulele
        (all to different standards but not at the same level as my trumpeting, yet!)</p>

        <!-- This is bad HTML. Above good, below bad.

        Why? Because it's a whole series of titles. <h2></h2> is a title, <h4></h4>
        is a title, and there are a whole load of them, one after the other, without
        any paragraphs. We say that this HTML is 'not semantic', because you are
        using the titles for how they look, rather than what they mean. And HTML
        is supposed to be all about what something means, not how it looks.

        How it looks is the job of your stylesheet, style.css.

        <!-- So how do we do these paragraphs the right way? This is where things
        start to get funky. All html tags can have a class attribute, that looks
        like this:

        <p class="class-name">Paragraph text</p>

        That text inside the class attribute, "class-name", that gives your
        stylesheet, style.css, a 'class' to hook onto. Anything with that class
        gets the styles specified in the stylesheet for that class. You are free
        to make class names up (there are restrictions about what a class can be
        made of but if you stick to letters and dashes you will avoid any problems).

        Now would be a good time to open style.css side-by-side with this document
        and have a look at the next couple of paragraphs I'm leaving here as an
        example. The classes for these are at the bottom of style.css.
        I'll leave you to sort out the abomination above!

        <!--
        There are many schools of thought about how to use classes the 'right' way.
        They cause wars between CSS developers. Don't pay too much heed to anything
        you read online about the 'right' way to do classes. There is no right way.
        You are free to use them how you want. You have enough here to get started.
